A 6 year's rage repository. Where I explain and write easy to understandable inference technique and code to excecute them on European supercomputers like JUPITER, JUWELS and Leonardo. 

**What you can find?**
1. Most fastest concoction of inference tips and techniques. That are well documented
2. Code to run them on colab
3. Code to run them on European Pre-exa and Exa-scale supercomputers.

These are tested and well-documented. I am planning to maintain this repository religiously. Filenames are self-explanatory + if you see a flag like `leo` or `juwel` it means it is supercomputer compatible code. I include my slurm scripts as well so have fun. 

**For colab code:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17U4lj2YLNH0GdxR9iovBnHdONB4QEh_a?usp=sharing
